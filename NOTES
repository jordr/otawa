GLISS NOTES

1. Many "is_host_little" definitions.
  GLISS generated source and original sources defines the function "is_host_little"
many. While it compiles with C compiler without any problem, C++ compiler
does not accepts this. Yet, these three version seems to have the same behaviour.
  A quick correction makes some version function "static" in the files 
  	- "src/iss_mem.c",
  	- "src/emul_mem.c".

2. "src/iss_mem.c/delete_mem()" not implemented.

3. "src/emul.c/iss_disasm()" never compiled
Bad constant name, should be "EMUL_DISASM".
Compile "gliss-ppc" with option "-DEMUL_DISASM" and "-DISS_DISASM".
