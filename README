Otawa 0.1 (2.18.04)

First version.
Most of interface class are provided but neither loader, nor architecture is
actually available. GLISS should be used for providing PPC support.

NOTE
Otawa 0.1 has been developed with GCC 3.3.1 but it should work with any GCC.
It requires also the ELM library, V0.1. Just unzip it and compile it in the base
directory of Otawa or add it in default include and library files.

TO DO
- Use GLISS for reading PPC architecture.
- Use GLISS library as the PPC ELF loader.
- Incorporating the Heptane compilation chain in the PPC ELF loader.
- Add AST classes.
- Add Heptane AST information for building the AST.
