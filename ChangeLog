* Auto{conf|make} build system improving for more flexiblity (selection of
optional module -- currently gliss or heptane, path for external dependencies
-- elm or glissppc).

* PROG: new method for building the CFG taking a positive view a branch (a CFG starts at a called block or if a function label exists for it).
* EXAMPLES: dumpcfg now inlines the function in its output (warning: "bl 1" or recursive function all are not yet supported).

2004-03-08  casse <hugues.casse@irit.fr>

* GLISS: added support for labels found in code (dissassembling and
  property linked to instructions and BB).
* GLISS: fixed bug in CodeSegment::findByAddress() avoiding retrieving a 
pseudo-instruction instead of a real instruction.
* PROG: added label table support in otawa::File and gliss::File.
* OSHELL: full support for labels in disassembing, CFG display and retrieval.

2004-03-18  casse <hugues.casse@laposte.net>

* GLISS: cleanup in gliss plug-in for filling the rule: one header and one
  source by top-level class.
* PROG: one header and one source by top-level class.
* PROG: added support for retrieving and using in CFG the real program entry
  point, support for retriving entry point CFG and recording sub-program in the
  CFG computation.
* PROG: safe deletion of the full Otawa framework.
* PROG: prototypes fixes for CFGInfo methods.
* PROG: added BasicBlock::getBlockSize().
* OSHELL: unprocessed commands from the current level are passed back to the
  parent level.
* OSHELL: cursor for named functions now displays the name.
* PROG: added iterator for BasicBlock.

2004-05-25  casse <hugues.casse@laposte.net>

* GLISS: bug fixes.
* PROG: bug fixes, added AST support.
* HEPTANE: module added (add only support for loading .ast file).
* OSHELL: added support for AST.
* EXAMPLES/DUMPCFG: example program outputting CFG of functions.
