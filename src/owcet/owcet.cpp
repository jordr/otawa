/**
 * @defgroup owcet owcet Command
 *
 * owcet command allows to compute WCET of an application using a script
 * provided for a particular architecture implementation. It provide full power
 * of OTAWA framework including selection of architecture-dependent plugin
 * and fine-tuned computation scripts.
 *
 * @par Syntax
 *
 * @code
 * SYNTAX: owcet [options] EXECUTABLE_PATH [TASK_ENTRY] -s SCRIPT_PATH
 * @endcode
 *
 * The @i EXECUTABLE_PATH must be the path of the executable file to compute WCET for.
 * This executable file must be in a machine language understood by OTAWA (currently OTAWA
 * supports PowerPC, ARM, Sparc, HCS12 and partly TriCore).
 *
 * The optional @i TASK_ENTRY designs the function to compute the WCET for and usually
 * matches a task in the real-time applications. If this parameter is not given,
 * the @tt main function is used.
 *
 * The @i SCRIPT_PATH is the path of the file containing the script. These file are usually
 * found in $OTAWA_HOME/share/Otawa/scripts. When an architecture plugin is installed,
 * it provides usually its own script.
 *
 * Other options includes:
 * @li -p, --param ID=VAL: several parameters with this form may be passed; these definition are used
 * to pass parameters to the script and the supported @i ID depends on the launched script (see its documentation
 * for more details),
 * @li -f, --flowfacts PATH: OTAWA can not automatically found loops so this options is used
 * to design the file containing loop bounds; supported formats includes .ff or .ffx (@ref ff). Flowfacts allows also
 * to pass specific configuration for the flow execution of a program.
 *
 * @par Hints
 *
 * Real-time systems do not usually perform formatted output as @tt printf family of functions but such a function
 * are often used in case of error. Usually formatting performed by @tt printf is big and complex piece of code
 * that, in the case we take it into account in the WCET computation, would dominate the execution time
 * and drive to a very overestimated WCET. To avoid this, you can command to OTAWA to ignore them
 * without recompiling your application. Just create a file named YOU_EXECUTABLE.ff and write inside:
 * @code
 * nocall "printf";
 * @endcode
 * You can do the like with any function disturbing your computation. You can find in @ref f4 more details
 * about the commande @tt .ff files. You may also use XML format called @tt .ffx (see @ref ffx).
